###### The idea
A simple Takeaway app for a Restaurant; where a customer can view a menu,
 add dishes to their order, place the order, and receive a text confirmation.
* The app will use the Twilio API 
 
###### User stories / app capabilities
_A user can:_ <br>
- [x] see a list of dishes with prices
- [x] select some number of several available dishes
- [ ] check that the total given matches the sum of the various dishes in the order
- [ ] receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed" after they ordered
- [ ] the text will also state the order's ETA (1 hour from oder time)
